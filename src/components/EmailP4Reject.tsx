    <p>
      Greetings <strong>Mr. {fathername}</strong> and <strong>Mrs. {mothername}</strong>. After careful assessment, we regret to inform you that <strong>{studentname}</strong> did not pass the school test.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand this may be disappointing, but this is not the end of your child's journey. Every child is unique and grows in different ways and timelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      We encourage you to continue supporting and guiding your child. Thank you again for considering SIRAJ Al-Alusi.
